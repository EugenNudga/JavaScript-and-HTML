# JavaScript-and-HTML
My JavaScript and HTML projects made during Computer Graphics laboratory works in HAW

Tasks for 3 labs:
1) A big sphere with small spheres inside that bounce on the internal side of the big one. One has to figure out physics and program this. Also make a sphere that is controlled with the keyboard.
2) Make an analog clock double sided with the local time on one side and your country time on the other. Again one has to figure out the math of the movement of the things.
3) Pool table with a few balls in it, do the math of collision on the bands and the balls, use lighting and shadows for everything.
